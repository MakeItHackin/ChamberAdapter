## DESCRIPTION:  
This SAO Adapter electrifies your Official DEF CON 31 Badge!  The Official DEF CON 31 Badge is not going to be electronic this year (2023).  Although we don't know what it looks like yet, DEF CON announced there will be a "chamber" in the badge in which you can insert... anything you want.  The SAO Adapter slides into that chamber (see reference pictures) and provides two SAO ports powered by 3.3 volts. You should be safe to power up to 350 milliamps.  Stickers and Googly Eyes are also included :)  The orange "badge simulator" you see in the photos is for reference only and is not included.

The SAO adapter is powered by a single AA battery, and three are included with your purchase!  One battery should last you around 10 hours, depending on which SAOs you power.  (power hungry SAOS will decrease battery life).  So the three batteries should last you Friday, Saturday, and Sunday at DEF CON!  

There was some extra space on the circuit board, so I added a tamper-evident sticker.  See if you can remove it without tearing or seeing the "VOID" part underneath.  Just be careful if you plan on using any kind of liquid or other material.  You don't want to damage the Adapter.  

A DIY BadgeLife SAO kit is included!  You can take this down to the Hardware Hacking village or other place with a soldering iron and assemble it.  There are four surface-mount components and one through-hole component.  

The mini lanyard that comes with the badge is meant to help stabilize and secure the Adapter to the Official DEF CON 31 Badge.  Insert the lanyard through the adapter and secure it to your badge or main lanyard.  This provides safety in case the adapter were to separate from the badge.
